# T20i-Score-Prediction
A model which predicts score of a T20 match based on some basic parameters.
I referred to a video on the same from CampusX on YouTube.
The dataset for the above was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/veeralakrishna/cricsheet-a-retrosheet-for-cricket
I used streamlit library which made the interface really good.
And used xgboost to get predictions.
The model is not very accurate but works well most of the times.
